Mï»¿icrosoft is going to be removing some of the Xbox 360's best games from the marketplace on February 7 including Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, original Dark Souls, a bunch of Assassin's Creed games and The Witcher 2, just to name a few. 

If you are yet to play Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon in particular, I would recommend picking these up - they are not available anywhere else. Siliconera has the [full list](https://www.siliconera.com/blue-dragon-and-lost-odyssey-being-delisted-from-xbox-360-marketplace/).
